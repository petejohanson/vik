## pmw3360

This module works fine, but was designed to use a 5v controller, and therefore used components that were not needed for VIK. This increased the cost of the pcb. So, to save some of that cost, there is a new one that replaces it. The value of this one is that you can wire it directly using a 5v controller, whereas the VIK one relies on a 3.3v controller.

Same explanation as for the pmw3360 above
