# joysticks vik module

## Overview

This is a vik module to support the following two joysticks:  
* [adafruit 2765](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2765)
* [sparkfun 9032](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9032)

Please note that this PCB does **not** support the click on the sparkfun analog joystick, only x and y movements

## Fabrication and BOM

For PCB fabrication, you can use the files in the production folder.

* gerbers.zip - the file used to fabricate the pcb
* bom.csv - used for PCBA. You can also use the part numbers in this file to look up the exact parts as [lcsc.com](https://lcsc.com)
* positions.csv - used for PCBA

Using the 3 files above, this has been tested at [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com)
